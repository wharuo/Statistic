HTML: Sets up the basic structure with two canvas elements for the charts and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
CSS: Styles the page for a clean and centered layout.
JavaScript: Uses Chart.js to create two bar charts:
The first chart displays the current recommended professions.
The second chart shows the jobs that will be in demand in three years.
You can update the currentProfessionsData and futureJobsData variables with real dynamic data sources or APIs as needed.
